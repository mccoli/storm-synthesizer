# installation
Ensure that your version of Processing is 3.0 or greater (so the Sound library will work properly). If you don't already have the Sound library, open the sketch and click Sketch > Import Library > Add Library, and search for Sound in the Filter bar.

# controls
mouse up/down: volume up/down
mouse left/right: pan sound from left to right speakers
key 1: taiko sticks
key 2: short deep taiko hit
key 3: medium taiko hit
key 4: long deep taiko hit
key 5: thunder and screen flash (hold this down if you are sensitive to flashing)
key 6: B3 note, sine wave
key 7: C#4 note, sine wave
key 8: F2 note, saw wave
You can only play two of the waves at any one time.

# to modify
You can comment out the full screen mode and uncommment 'size(400, 400, P3D)' for more of a mini-player version. You can also adjust the colours by changing the last number within the rgb parameters in the shape tab.
